This assignment took me about 8 hours to do (including the time on studying, designing, and writing the code).

My secret code from section 2.1 was: e1efc680cb

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: It took a long time to set up the development environment. I didn't like using virtualbox, so I tried to configure the environment in docker, but it was difficult to configure the compilation environment, and I created an environment where I could compile lab0 but from my senior experience that future tasks would not be compiled, I eventually installed virtualbox and conducted the final test.

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: As for the assignment, I could understand to some extent what you wanted to ask, and it could be solved in a reasonable amount of time. However, I hope there will be improvements to the task execution environment. (Working on os based on Ubuntu 18.04 in 2025 is not a pleasant experience, I think.)

- Optional: I was surprised by: When I saw the concept of ByteStream only in writing, I didn't feel it well, but I could understand exactly what it was doing in the implementation process and it was easier than I thought.

- Optional: I'm not sure about: Actually, I had some difficulties because I wasn't familiar with the c++ grammar. There are so many different ways to initialize the member variables of the class that I'm not sure which one to choose. I also implemented an auxiliary function, _min, which I'm not sure is appropriate to implement as a member function of the class (whether it's more common to use macros, etc.).
